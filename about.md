I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Software System Science at Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg. Completed my BSc(Engg) in Computer Science and Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. I am always interested in learning something new. I believe software can make our life a whole lot easier. Still, there are many things we can build as a software engineer which can make people's life a lot simpler. There is always room for improvement; there is no absolute right way of doing things, which makes this job so much fun for me.

  aboutMe:
    "Nine years as a full-stack engineer have taught me to care just as much about the \"why\" as the \"how.\" At Kuehne+Nagel, this meant acting as a natural bridge between the business side and the developers. My strength lies in taking a product owner's big idea and turning it into a realistic plan that a team can actually ship. I’m at my best when balancing a strong technical vision with a solid delivery timeline to ensure the right problems are solved on schedule.",
